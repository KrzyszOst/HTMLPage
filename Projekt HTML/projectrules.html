                <h1>Basic Rules of Play</h1>
                <p><span><strong>Article 1: The nature and objectives of the game of chess</strong></span></p>
                    <p>1.1 The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately
                    on a square board called a ‘chessboard’. The player with the white pieces commences the
                    game. A player is said to ‘have the move’, when his opponent’s move has been ‘made’.</p>
                    <p>1.2 The objective of each player is to place the opponent’s king ‘under attack’ in such a way
                    that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have
                    ‘checkmated’ the opponent’s king and to have won the game. Leaving one’s own king
                    under attack, exposing one’s own king to attack and also ’capturing’ the opponent’s king
                    are not allowed. The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.</p>
                    <p>1.3 If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is drawn.</p>
                        <p><strong>Article 2: The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard</strong></p>
                        <p>2.1 The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares alternately light (the
                        ‘white’ squares) and dark (the ‘black’ squares).
                        The chessboard is placed between the players in such a way that the near corner square
                        to the right of the player is white.</p>
                        <p>2.2 At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-coloured pieces (the ‘white’ pieces);
                        the other has 16 dark-coloured pieces (the ‘black’ pieces).</p>
                        <p>2.3 The eight vertical columns of squares are called ‘files’. The eight horizontal rows of
                            squares are called ‘ranks’. A straight line of squares of the same colour, running from one
                            edge of the board to an adjacent edge, is called a ‘diagonal’</p>
                            <p><strong>Article 3: The act of moving the pieces</strong></p>
                            <p>3.1 Each move must be made with one hand only.</p>
                                <p>3.2 Provided that he first expresses his intention (for example by saying „j’adoube“ or “I
                                adjust”), the player having the move may adjust one or more pieces on their squares.</p>
                                <p>3.3 Except as provided in Article 3.2, if the player having the move deliberately touches on
                                the chessboard:</p>
                                <div class="tab">
                                <p>a. one or more of his own pieces, he must move the first piece touched which can be
                                moved</p>
                                <p> b. one or more of his opponent’s pieces, he must capture the first piece touched
                                which can be captured</p>
                                <p>c. one piece of each colour, he must capture the opponent’s piece with his piece or, if
                                this is illegal, move or capture the first piece touched which can be moved or</p><p>
                                captured. If it is unclear, whether the player’s own piece or his opponent’s was
                                touched first, the player’s own piece shall be considered to have been touched
                                </p><p>before his opponent’s.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>3.4 If a player having the move:</p>
                                <div class="tab">
                                <p>a. deliberately touches his king and rook he must castle on that side if it is legal to do
                                so</p>
                                <p>b. deliberately touches a rook and then his king he is not allowed to castle on that side
                                on that move and the situation shall be governed by Article 3.3.a</p>
                                <p>c. intending to castle, touches the king or king and rook at the same time, but castling
                                on that side is illegal, the player must make another legal move with his king <p>(which
                                may include castling on the other side). If the king has no legal move, the player is
                                free to make any legal move</p>
                                <p>d. promotes a pawn, the choice of the piece is finalised, when the piece has touched
                                the square of promotion.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>3.5 If none of the pieces touched can be moved or captured, the player may make any legal
                                move.</p>
                                <p>3.6 When, as a legal move or part of a legal move, a piece has been released on a square, it
                                cannot be moved to another square on this move. The move is then considered to have
                                been made:</p>
                                <div id="tab">
                                <p>a. in the case of a capture, when the captured piece has been removed from the
                                chessboard and the player, having placed his own piece on its new square, has
                                </p><p>released this capturing piece from his hand</p>
                                <p>b. in the case of castling, when the player's hand has released the rook on the square
                                previously crossed by the king. When the player has released the king from his
                                </p><p>hand, the move is not yet made, but the player no longer has the right to make any
                                move other than castling on that side, if this is legal</p>
                                <p>c. in the case of the promotion of a pawn, when the pawn has been removed from the
                                chessboard and the player's hand has released the new piece after placing it</p><p>on the
                                promotion square. If the player has released from his hand the pawn that has
                                reached the promotion square, the move is not yet made, but the player no</p><p>longer
                                has the right to play the pawn to another square.
                                The move is called legal when all the relevant requirements of Article 3 have been
                                fulfilled. If the move is </p><p>not legal, another move shall be made instead as per Article 3.5.</p>
                                </div>
                                3.7 A player forfeits his right to a claim against his opponent’s violation of Article 3 once he
                                deliberately touches a piece
                                <p><strong>Article 4: The completion of the game</strong></p>
                                <p>4.1</p> <div class="tab"><p>a. The game is won by the player who has checkmated his opponent’s king. This
                                    immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate
                                    </p><p>position was a legal move.</p>
                                    <p>b. The game is won by the player whose opponent declares he resigns. This
                                    immediately ends the game.</p></div>

                                    <p>4.2</p><div class="tab"><p>a. The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his king is not in
                                    check. The game is said to end in ‘stalemate’. This immediately ends the</p><p> game,
                                    provided that the move producing the stalemate position was legal.</p>
                                    <p>b. The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can
                                    checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to
                                    end</p><p> in a ‘dead position’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move
                                    producing the position was legal.</p>
                                    <p>c. The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game. This
                                    immediately ends the game.</p>
                                    <p>d. The game may be drawn if any identical position is about to appear or has appeared
                                    on the chessboard at least three times. </p>
                                    <p>e. The game may be drawn if each player has made at least the last 50 consecutive
                                    moves without the movement of any pawn and without any capture.</p></div>
