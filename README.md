🌐 Chess-Themed Personal Website ♟️  
This is a university project for the **Hypertext & Hypermedia** course. The goal was to create a personal website using HTML and CSS — and I chose my passion: **Chess**.

🚀 Features:
- 🎨 Custom Layout: Clean, informative design using only HTML and CSS.
- ♟️ Chess Content: Covers chess rules, figures, top players, and a short survey.
- 📱 Responsive Design: Looks good on various screen sizes.

```
